# User Onboarding Project

## Overview

The **User Onboarding Project** is a comprehensive web application designed to capture the entire user onboarding journey. It includes functionalities for user signup, login, forgot password, reset password, user verification, and user preferences. This project demonstrates the implementation of these features on both the frontend and backend. While this README focuses on a JavaScript implementation, the project is designed to be adaptable to other languages and frameworks.

## Features

- **Signup**: Register a new user account with email, name, username, and password.
- **Login**: Authenticate existing users using their credentials.
- **Forgot Password**: Initiate a password recovery process.
- **Reset Password**: Update the userâ€™s password after verification.
- **User Verification**: Upload an ID photo or take a selfie for verification.
- **User Preferences**: Collect user preferences during onboarding.

## Technologies Used

- **Vanilla JavaScript**: For handling frontend and backend functionalities (in the Vanilla JavaScript implementation).
- **HTML/CSS**: For the structure and styling of the frontend.
- **Node.js and Express**: For backend server and API endpoints (in the Vanilla JavaScript implementation).

## Installation

To run this project locally using the Vanilla JavaScript implementation, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Markkimotho/sign-up-form.git
    cd sign-up-form
    ```

2. **Set Up the Backend**:
    - Navigate to the backend directory:
      ```bash
      cd backend
      ```
    - Install dependencies:
      ```bash
      npm install
      ```
    - Run the server:
      ```bash
      npm start
      ```

3. **Open the Frontend**:
    - Navigate to the frontend directory:
      ```bash
      cd ../frontend
      ```
    - Open `index.html` in your web browser to interact with the frontend.

## Usage

1. **Signup**: 
    - Fill in the registration form with your email, first name, last name, username, and password.
    - Optionally, sign up using Gmail, Twitter, or Facebook.
    - Provide additional information such as country, address, and phone number.
    - Accept the terms and conditions.

2. **Login**:
    - Enter your username and password to access your account.

3. **Forgot Password**:
    - Initiate the password recovery process by providing your email address.

4. **Reset Password**:
    - Follow the instructions sent to your email to reset your password.

5. **User Verification**:
    - Upload an ID photo or take a real-time selfie for verification.

6. **User Preferences**:
    - Select at least three categories of interest.

## Adaptations

This project is designed to be adaptable to other languages and frameworks. You can implement the functionalities described above using different technologies by:

- **Frontend**: Adapting the frontend code to other JavaScript frameworks (e.g., React, Vue) or other frontend technologies (e.g., Angular).
- **Backend**: Implementing the backend functionalities using different languages and frameworks (e.g., Python with Flask/Django, Java with Spring Boot).

## Deployment

To deploy the project, ensure that both the frontend and backend are properly configured and running. Follow the deployment instructions for the chosen technologies and host the frontend files on a web server or static hosting service.
